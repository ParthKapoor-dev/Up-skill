# Smart Education Platform

This project aims to enhance student consistency and comprehension in online courses by implementing a feature where students must answer a set of questions, with at least 30% correct answers required to progress to the next lecture. The platform integrates AI summaries of lectures and utilizes face recognition for student authentication.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js

## Problem:
Students often lack consistency and may struggle with comprehension in online courses, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes.

## Solution:
Implemented a smart education platform that enforces student consistency by requiring them to answer a set of questions, ensuring comprehension and enabling progress only upon meeting a 30% correct answer threshold. Additionally, AI summaries and face recognition are integrated to enhance the learning experience and security of the platform.

## Features:
- **Question-Based Progression:** Students must answer a set of questions with a minimum of 30% correct answers to access the next lecture.
- **AI Lecture Summaries:** Provides AI-generated summaries of lectures for improved comprehension.
- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes face recognition technology for student authentication and security.
- **Tech Stack:** Developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for efficient development and scalability.

## Installation:
